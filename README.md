This project, Match & Bill, internship assignment by Taag Media focused on simulating two core areas of the platform: Brand â†” Creator Matching and Billing & Payout Flow. The frontend assignment involves building a responsive web app with a Brand Brief Form (brand details with templates), a Match Console (displaying creators from sample JSON/mock API with scores, bars, reason chips, and filters), and a Billing & Payout Flow (two-step form with inline validation, GST calculation, and print/save summary), ensuring a smooth and mobile-friendly UI/UX. The backend assignment requires designing APIs and data models for Creator, Brand, and Billing, implementing a Matching API (POST /api/match) with weighted scoring (relevance 40%, audience fit 30%, performance/price 20%, constraints 10%) plus diversification rules, and Billing APIs (POST /api/billing/brand and /api/billing/creator) with validations for GSTIN, PAN, IFSC, and UPI, returning GST-inclusive summaries. Optional enhancements include authentication, PDF invoice generation, or campaign idea suggestions. Deliverables include a GitHub repo, deploy/run instructions, seed script, and Postman/Swagger collection, with evaluation based on UI/UX, validation, match display, scoring clarity, API design, code quality, and extras.
